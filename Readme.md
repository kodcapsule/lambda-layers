## Introduction

Serverless computing is a computing technique  and an execution model that enables you to build and run application code without having to think about provissioning and managing servers and or back-end infrastructure. In Aws Lambda, a serverles service is the backbone when it comes to building serverless applications on AWS. AWS Lambda allaws you to focus on your application code whiles it handles infrastructure managent, auto scaling and other heavy lifting.


As your  serverless applications grows in complexity and the number of Lambda functions becomes numerious, certain challenges , dependency management and code reuse, are innevitable. To address these issues our hero , Lambda Layers comes to the rescue In this article we will  explores everything you need to know about Lambda Layers, from the basics to some  advanced concepts. 


## Understanding AWS Lambda Layers
A lambda layer is a spercial container , a `.zip` file archive  that  contains supplementary code or data. Lambda layers serves as a distribution mechanisim for function dependencies,custom runtimes, or configuration files for your lambda functions. Layers let you keep your functions deployment packages small and organized by separating your function code from its dependencies.

### How Layers Work

A layer essentially bundles code or data into a `ZIP` archive that is automatically extracted by the lambder service into the `/opt`  directory in your functionâ€™s execution environment. Your function code can then access the Layer's content during it's  execution.

Layers operate using a simple workflow.
- 1. First, you package your functions dependencies or shared code into a `ZIP` file.
- 2. You then create and publish the Layer to the  Lambda service .
- 3. After creating the you can  can attach the layer to one or more lambda functions.
- 4. When your function executes, it can then access the Layer's content as if it were part of the function's deployment package.

Lambda allows you to add up to a maxium of five Layers per function and  the layer content still counts towards the function's deployment package size quota (i.e. 250MB for .zip file archives).
**NOTE** All the packages in your layer must  be Linux compatible, since  Lambda functions run on Amazon Linux.



### Layer Versions 
Lambda layers are versioned.  A layer version is an unchangeable snapshot of a layer's specific release.  When you add a new layer, Lambda creates a new layer version with the version number 1.  When you publish an update to a layer, Lambda automatically increments the version  version number by 1 and creates a new layer version.
Each layer version has a distinct Amazon Resource Name (ARN). When adding a layer to a function, make sure to specify the layer version you want to use



### Benefits of Using Lambda Layers

-**1.Reduced the size of a function's deployment packages:**Instead of include all of your function dependencies in your deployment package, place them in a layer.  This keeps deployment bundles simple and manageable.
-**2.Separation of Concerns:**Layers can help  separate your function's  business logic from its dependencies dependencies and allows different team members to focus on different aspects of the application.
-**3.Code Reusability**Layers allow you to share dependencies across multiple lambda functions. Without layers, you need to include the same dependencies in each of your function's deployment package which goes agains the the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle in programming.
-**4.To use the Lambda console code editor:**The code editor is a helpful tool for rapidly evaluating small changes to function code.  However, if your deployment package is too big, you won't be able to use the editor.  Layers allow you to use the code editor and reduce the size of your package.
-**5.Faster Deployment Times:**Smaller deployment packages mean faster uploads and quicker Lambda function updates. This efficiency becomes particularly valuable in CI/CD pipelines where deployment speed impacts overall development velocity.


### Common Use Cases for AWS Lambda Layers

-**1.Database Connectors:**Database drivers and connectors frequently include complex dependencies.  Centralising everything in Layers ensures that database access patterns are uniform throughout your functions.
-**2.Monitoring and Logging Utilities:**By putting instrumentation code for monitoring, logging, and tracing in a shared layer, it can be used across functions without any changes. This makes sure that your program uses the same observability practices.
-**3.Internal Company Libraries:**Many organisations frequently develop internal tools and libraries. Packing these tools and libraries as Layers encourages reuse and standardisation across projects in the organization.
-**4.Frameworks and SDKs:**Layers can be used  to package complete frameworks or SDKs, ensuring that there is  consistency in functions.  This approach is ideal for organization-specific frameworks or huge third-party SDKs that might otherwise bloat your function packages.

### Layer Directory Structure Requirements
Lambda Layers must adhere to distinct directory structure depending on the runtime the layer targets. These directory structure  ensures that the Lambda service can properly locate and load your Layer's content. 

**Python**
- Place your layer packages in the `python/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages/` directory
- Ensure compatibility with the Lambda Python runtime version
- Consider using tools like `pip install -t` to install packages to the correct location

**Node.js**
- Place node modules in the `nodejs/node_modules/` directory
- Be mindful of native dependencies that might require compilation for the Lambda environment
- Use `npm install` with the `--production` flag to exclude development dependencies

**Java**
- Place JAR files in the `java/lib/` directory
- Consider using Maven or Gradle to manage dependencies
- Be aware of classpath configuration when accessing Layer resources

**Ruby**
- Place gems in the `ruby/gems/X.Y.0/` directory
- Use `bundle install --path` to install gems to the correct location
- Ensure gemspec compatibility with the Lambda environment



## Creating Your First Lambda Layer
![Lambda Layer Architecture](/images/layer-example.gif)

In this section i will walk you through  the process of creating and using  Lambda Layers. In this demo i will be creating a python application that generates a short url given a long url. The main dependencies, will be bundled in a lambda layer.

First we will create a python virtual environments at install all the neccessory dependencies

### Prepare your   Lambda layer Content 
**Step 1** Creat a Python virtual environment 
```bash
  python -m venv venv
```
**Step 2** Activate the virtual environment and install the dependcies in the requiremnets.txt file
```bash
  source venv/Scripts/activate
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
**Step 3** Create a directory called `python`
```bash
  mkdir python 
```
> **Important**: The directory structure matters! Python packages must be in a directory named `python` to be automatically added to the PYTHONPATH when the layer is attached to a Lambda function.
**Step 4** copy the content in venv/Lib/site-packages/ to python/
```bash
   cp -r venv/Lib/site-packages/* python/
```
**Step 4** Zip the content of the python directory
```bash
  zip -r python.zip python
```
### Create your Lambda Layer in AWS
#### Method 1:Using AWS Console
    Open the AWS Lambda console
    Navigate to "Layers" in the left navigation
    Click "Create layer"
    Enter details:
    Name: Give your layer a descriptive name (e.g., url-shortner-lib)
    Description: Optional description of what's in the layer
    Upload ZIP: Upload your python-layer.zip file
    Compatible runtimes: Select the appropriate runtimes (e.g., python3.10 python3.11 python3.12 etc.)
    Click "Create" to publish your layer

  

#### Method 2:Using AWS CLI
  ```bash
  aws lambda publish-layer-version \
    --layer-name url-shortner-lib \
    --description "Layer contains all the dependecies for the url-shortener lambda function" \
    --zip-file fileb://python-layer.zip \
    --compatible-runtimes python3.10 python3.11 python3.12
  ```
> **Important**: If the size of your pyhon.zip file is greater than 10mb, it is recommended to uplaod the zip file to an S3 bucket and use the object ARN.



### Create your Lambda Function in AWS
#### Method 1:Using AWS Console

#### Method 2:Using AWS CLI


### Use the Layer in Your Lambda Function

### **Crating a Lambda function**
**Python Layer Directory Structure**
```bash
layer-content/
â””â”€â”€ python/
      â”œâ”€â”€ pyshorteners/
      â”œâ”€â”€ qrcode/
      â””â”€â”€ ...
               
                
```
